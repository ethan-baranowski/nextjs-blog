# Understanding Cloud Migration

Cloud migration involves transferring data, applications, and workloads from on-premises physical servers to cloud-based environments.
`Microsoft Azure` is a popular choice for businesses looking to leverage the cloud's flexibility and scalability, as well as `AWS`.

# Migration Planning

If the goal is to `reduce cost`, `improve scalability`, `increase efficiency` of IT and business operations, then approaching migration
with these things in mind is important. An object-oriented and detail-oriented plan is neccessary.

## Current Infrastructure

The obvious first step before diving into the deep end of migration would be to have a thorough understanding of the current server environment(s).
From personal experience, assuming you opted for `Azure`, using their `Azure Migrate` tool can help inventory your existing infrastructure. Additionally
this would help identify any dependencies that might exist.

## Risk Assessment

Risks such as data loss, downtime, or even compatibility issues should be addressed before hand as well. `Azure` has tools such as `Azure Backup`
for data protection and `Site Recovery` for continuity. These can be used to help mitigate or minimize these risks.
